#Refactor Homework
*I consolidated the css file eliminating repitative classes and id's. 
created a codebase that follows accesility standards. 

##Accesibility:
*Added readable text  in images using the 'alt' attribute for all image to add the descriptive details.

##Semantics:
*Created a **body** element to identify a body contained in the html file to edit and modify the **div** elements. 

##Concision:
*Removed id's 
*Refactored some of the classes in CSS to maintain functionality.
